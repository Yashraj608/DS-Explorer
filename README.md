**DS Explorer** is my **personal side project** in C++ that provides a **complete platform to explore and interact with all essential data structures**. From arrays to advanced trees and heaps, it’s a **learning-friendly, interactive, and menu-driven tool**.  

---

## 📚 Features

This project includes **all major data structures**:

- **Arrays** – Basic operations, indexing, traversal  
- **Linked Lists** – Singly linked lists: insert, delete, traverse  
- **Stacks & Queues** – Array and pointer-based implementations, including circular queues  
- **Trees**:
  - **Binary Tree** – Level-order insertion, deletion, search, and traversals  
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – Sorted insertions, deletions, and traversals  
  - **AVL Tree** – Self-balancing BST with rotations for optimal height  
- **Heaps** – Max Heap: insert, delete, and heapify  
- **Graphs** *(expandable in future versions)* – Representations and traversals

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Launch the program and select a **data structure** from the main menu.  
2. Perform operations such as:  
   - **Insert** elements/nodes  
   - **Delete** elements/nodes  
   - **Search** for elements/nodes  
   - **Traverse**: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level-order  
3. Navigate back to the main menu to explore **different data structures** like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and heaps.  
4. Experiment freely to learn **how each data structure works** interactively.
